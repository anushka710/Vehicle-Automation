# Vehicle-Automation
Vehicular automation involves the use of mechatronics, artificial intelligence, and multi-agent systems to assist the operator of a vehicle (car, aircraft, watercraft, or otherwise).
## 5 levels of autonomous driving
The classification of the development stages up to the self-driving vehicle comes from the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and describes the extent to which the vehicle can and may take over the tasks of the driver.

The levels of autonomous driving range from 0 with no assistance systems at all to Level 5, which describes fully autonomous driving.
Level 0 Autonomous Driving – manual driving,
Level 1 Autonomous Driving – driver assistance,
Level 2 Autonomous Driving – partial automation,
Level 3 Autonomous Driving – conditional automation,
Level 4 Autonomous Driving – high automation,
Level 5 Autonomous Driving – full automation.
